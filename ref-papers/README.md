# Reference papers

This folder stores reading copies. The website should cite individual claims with a paper and section/page, rather than linking a bibliography alone. Local availability does not establish permission to republish a PDF; public pages can link to the official source.

- Scope: security attacks and defenses, privacy techniques, frameworks, and non-IID-related trade-offs.
- Role: additional recent coverage; verify particular claims against the original studies.

The newer entries were selected by checking their abstracts and publication/version metadata, not by completing a critical review of their full contents. This is a reading shortlist, not an exhaustive or ranked survey bibliography. Metadata checked: 2026-10-22.

## Evidence record to use in future concept pages

For each claim, record: claim ID, wording, source ID, section/page/algorithm, applicable assumptions, and whether it is a paper result, our interpretation, or our own experiment. Experiments should additionally record code version, configuration, data partition, random seeds, and metric definitions.

Added: 2026-10-22. Check the folder for actual PDF availability; source links remain the canonical records.
